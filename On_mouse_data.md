# Pipeline of genomics on mice data

â€‹	Based on the current study, there are really barely analysis of `WGS` and `WES` on mice data. Although, [MoCaSeq](https://github.com/roland-rad-lab/MoCaSeq) had provided a systematic analysis pipelines on mice data, it almost based on the `GRcm38` version genome reference. If you used (or plan to use) the `mm10` as the references to process, that's  not easy  to make it on  [MoCaSeq](https://github.com/roland-rad-lab/MoCaSeq). Here, we provide a pipeline of genomics analysis on mice data based on the `mm10`, and we plan to make it much more flexible and easier to  understand each step in processing. 

Now, let's begin our pipeline of **whole genome sequencing (WGS)** data analysis on mice data

- ### Step2. somatic SNVs detcted in each sample
